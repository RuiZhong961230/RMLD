# RMLD

Recursive Monotonicity and Linearity Detection for Large-scale Optimization Problems

The source code of RMLD was initially developed by Mohammad Nabi Omidvar and modified by Yuan Sun published in RDG [1].
The decomposition in RMLD is programmed using MATLAB, and the optimization is programmed using Python.
Necessary packages: cec2013lsgo
